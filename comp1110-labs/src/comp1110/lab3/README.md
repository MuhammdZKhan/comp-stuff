# COMP1110 Lab 3

## Purpose

In this lab you will develop a slightly more complex Java program and will form groups for the group assignment.

**It is essential that you complete this lab and have a tutor mark it off**.

## Tasks

1. **Create, debug and test the Point class.**

    In the Java package `comp1110.lab3`, within your labs repo, create a new Java class, `Point`, which represents a cartesian (xy) point. Both `x` and `y` should be stored as `doubles`. The class should have two public methods. The first is `toString()`, which displays the point as a string (e.g. if x = 10.0 and y = 3.0 then it would return the string (10.0, 3.0)). The second, called `euc`, returns, as a double, the distance between the point and the origin (i.e. the euclidian distance to the origin, the distance between the point and (0.0, 0.0)). Implement `Point` with a main method that reads in two doubles (on separate lines), uses them to create a `Point` object, calls the `euc` nethod, and then prints out the distance to the origin. Test your work using the provided `PointTest` class. Commit all of your work to git, push, and show your tutor.

2. **Assignment Groups.**

    During today's lab you are required to form a group for the assignment. The group must be composed only of members of your lab group, and must have three members (because lab sizes are not necessarily multiples of three, your tutor may allow a maximum of two groups per lab to have have two members). A key element of this course is completion of this group project, so successful group formation is a very important step.

3. **Lab test 2.**

    Use any spare time you have to work on preparing for lab test 2 and working on your group assignment.
